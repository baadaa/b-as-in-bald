    <h3>Situation:</h3>
    <p>The day before New Year's eve, I felt seriously inspired to create a personal greeting card&mdash;realizing that it is all the people I've encountered in life that makes me who I am now.

    <h3>Sprint:</h3>
    <p>It took me ten straight hours to complete this piece from start to finish&mdash;<em>writing, sketching, recording, animating, and HTML email coding</em>&mdash;. Sent out via email on the New Year's Eve at sunrise, the video message was extremely well-received from family, friends, colleagues, and clients.
