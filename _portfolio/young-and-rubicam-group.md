    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
    <p>Going through a name change from <em>Young &amp; Rubicam Brands</em> to <em>Young &amp; Rubicam Group</em>, the firm needed a new visual identity system developed. A holding company consisting of top-notch agencies in premium marketing and communications services, they hoped to better signal the unified platform for the partner companies without overpowering individual brand visual identities.

    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p>Under the main creative direction&mdash;<em>the use of ampersand to communicate collectivity and multi-color palette to celebrate the variety</em>&mdash;I first developed the color scheme in collaboration with Landor Associates. Once the logotype and ampersand graphic established, I worked closely with Global Brand Officer to create a series of real-life applications: from stationery sets to corporate events, to interactive web apps, and to interior/exterior signage systems. The overarching visual concept was the multiplicity of ampersands in vibrant colors to communicate <em>a wide range of expertise in unison</em>.
