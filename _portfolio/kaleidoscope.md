    <h3>Concept:</h3>
    <p>Senses, <em>especially smell or taste</em>, can trigger powerful and vivid memories&mdash;<em>and emotions</em>&mdash;of the past, as is often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_memory" target="_blank"><em>involuntary memory</em></a> or <em>the Proust Effect</em>. Should a childhood comfort food prompt nostalgic emotions, <strong>what if</strong> we could trigger such involuntary memories <em>voluntarily</em>?
    In this conceptual piece, I imagined a <em>restaurant that serves food to evoke memories and emotions</em>. A guest chooses a menu, selects the <em>kind of</em> memories to trigger <span style="color:#CCC;">(<em>like, "I'm in the mood for some bitter-sweet memories today"</em>)</span>, and gets served with involuntary memory as they eat.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> is a metaphoric reference to dream-like yet vivid emotional quality of Proustian moments, and naturally lends itself to kaleidoscopic aesthetics throughout the video to set the tone.
