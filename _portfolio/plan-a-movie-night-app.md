    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
    <p>When organizing a movie night with friends, choosing the film to watch together can be a painful process. The larger the group, the harder to select the perfect movie that <em>everybody</em> would enjoy watching. How do you make it easy to gather friends, pick time and place, and most importantly, select the perfect film to screen?
    </p>

    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p>At the core of this project was the need for an impeccable recommendation engine. The app would present you a wide range of films in an <small>IMDb</small>-like manner, through which users can browse and learn more about each film. At each review, users are asked three simple questions: <em><small>1) did you watch this film? 2) would you watch it with your friends? 3) how bad do you want to watch it?</small></em> As user's answers accumulate, the app cross-references and analyzes movie tastes between friends connected via Facebook. Now, when ready for a gathering, simply choose the date and time, send invitation to friends, and the app will take care of the rest by recommending the impeccable film to watch together.

    <h3>Execution:</h3>
    <p>Each team member divided responsibilities by <small>MODEL</small>, <small>VIEW</small>, and <small>CONTROLLER</small> part of the development, based on <small>MVC</small> pattern. <strong>My role was</strong> to design and build the <small>VIEW</small> component&mdash;that is, to architect the user experience, design user interface and layout, and ultimately program the front-end view of the application using iOS native <small>SWIFT</small>. The other members would separately develop <small>MODEL</small> and <small>CONTROLLER</small> components that handle recommendation engine and other back-end functionality, and plug them into the front-end <small>VIEW</small>.
    </p>

    <h3>Limitation:</h3>
    <p>Three-week sprint resulted in functional front-end shell of the app, but the complete app never got to come to fruition. Although <small>API</small> integration was well on its way with Facebook and <small>TMDb</small>, the core recommendation engine development came to a halt as the responsible team members got pulled into other engagements.
