  <h1>iOS app that help organize a movie night events by assessing participants' tastes and suggesting the best film to watch together.</h1>
  <section class="info">
    <h3>Duties:</h3>
    <p>visual identity design, communication consultation</p>
  </section>
  <section class="info">
    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
    <p>At the core of this self-initiated team project was the need for an impeccable recommendation engine. When organizing a movie night with friends, choosing the film to watch together can be a painful process. The larger the group, the harder to select the perfect movie that <em>everybody</em> would enjoy watching. How do you make it easy to gather friends, pick time and place, and most importantly, select the perfect film to screen?
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="info">
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p>The app would present you a wide range of films in an <small>IMDb</small>-like manner, through which users can browse and learn more about each film. At each review, users are asked three simple questions: <em>1) did you watch this film? 2) would you watch it with your friends? 3) how bad do you want to watch it?</em> As user's answers accumulate, the app cross-references and analyzes movie tastes between friends connected via Facebook. Now, when ready for a gathering, simply choose the date and time, send invitation to friends, and the app will take care of the rest by recommending the impeccable film to watch together.
