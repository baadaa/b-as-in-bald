<section class="project-summary">
  <h1>Create a happy, memorable experience for both newly-weds and guests&mdash;visually story of two people's lives, engaging event props, immersive video contents, all in one place. Personal project for my own wedding.</h1>
  <section class="info">
    <h3>Duties:</h3>
    <p>art direction, event direction, design, develop, production, writing</p>
  </section>
  <section class="info">
    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
    <p>In just five months, we had to finish securing the venue, designing/producing all the materials, and planning the event. Aside from the tight timeframe, Young-Mi and I were both busy working full-time&mdash;in <em>New York</em> while preparing for the wedding in <em>Seoul</em>, half the globe away.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="info">
    <h3>Website:</h3>
    <p>We had two groups of audience&mdash;Americans who don't speak Korean and Koreans who don't speak English, and it was a <em>given</em> that we needed a bilingual site as a central piece. To make it more than another boring wedding invitation site, I wanted to bring more of authentic personal stories of ours, sharing how these two individuals grew up and ended up together. Taking advantage of readily available <small>WordPress</small> plugins, I built a visual essay with <small>RSVP</small> and guestbook weaved into it&mdash;which I later turned into a static <small>HTML/CSS</small> site for better performance.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="info">
    <h3>Video Interview:</h3>
    <p>We compiled a reel of video greetings from our New York friends, and screened at the wedding in Seoul. While none from our New York circle could come to Seoul, they could virtually be a part of the event, and for the Korean guest who knew nothing about our New York life could take a glimpse into what we've built in America.</p>

    <h3>Serenade for&nbsp;the Bride:</h3>
    <p>I was going to sing for Young-Mi as part of the event, and needed a backdrop imagery. What better way is there to commemorate our days together than to show what we've been through together? I've collected and curated hundreds and hundreds of photos and videos we had taken while dating, and created a collage piece. Once an instrumental track was mixed into it, we were ready for karaoke.</p>

    <h3>Printed Materials:</h3>
    <p>Designing materials was not so big of a challenge but producing them remotely was. I had no experience with print vendors in Korea and didn't know any quality print shop either. TO BE WRITTEN.
