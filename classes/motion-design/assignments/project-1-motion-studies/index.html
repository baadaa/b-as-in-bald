						</div>
      			<p>For our first project, you will choose one or more of the Gestalt principles listed below (and explained more in-depth at the end of this page) and use them as a point of departure from which to develop the concept and design for a series of three short (10-15 second) motion sequences. The goal of the sequences is to communicate the selected principle, utilizing the traditional design attributes of composition, color, shape, depth, tension, and contrast, while beginning to explore time-based attributes such as pacing, rhythm, and sequence. Design elements to be incorporated are abstract shapes, letterforms, and sound—no representational forms or readable text are to be used for this project (incorporated letterforms should be treated as shapes, not as pieces of words).</p>

<p>As much as this project is an exercise in formal design skills an introduction to After Effects, it’s also an exercise in using a time-based media to construct a narrative. Even short, simple motion graphics without recognizable imagery or readable text have a tone and mood, a beginning, middle, and end, and the fundamental change and progression that make a narrative.</p>

<strong>Group critique storyboards</strong>. <br><em><strong>Due this class</strong></em>: Select visual principle(s) and audio clips that you are interested in working with and use these selections to develop 5 sets of storyboards for 5 distinct motion study concepts – sketched by hand. (You should be creating 5 sheets/pages (each 11”x17”) of sketches of design concepts for your selected Gestalt principle.) The exact number of frames per storyboard depends on what is needed for your individual concept and will vary, but overall, since these animations are short, they should only require a few frames each (approximately 4-8 frames per storyboard).</td>

<h2 id="gestalt-principles-explained">Gestalt principles explained</h2>
<p>Gestalt psychology, developed in the 1920s by German psychologists, is about perception and grouping. The gestalt principles below describe ways that people tend to subconsciously organize visual elements into groups when these elements are arranged in certain ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="figure-ground">Figure-Ground</h3>
    <p>The relationship between a perceived object (figure) and the perceived space (ground) that it exists in. Our perception of what is figure and what is ground is not absolute—the relationship of visual elements can cause it to shift.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proximity">Proximity</h3>
    <p>Objects placed close together are often perceived as a group, rather than as separate shapes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="similarity">Similarity</h3>
    <p>Objects that look or act similar to one another are often perceived as a group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="symmetry">Symmetry</h3>
    <p>When objects are arranged in a balanced composition, they are often perceived as a whole rather than individually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="closure">Closure</h3>
    <p>People have a tendency to fill in missing information in order to perceive an object as whole. If enough of a shape is indicated, it can be perceived as whole if incomplete or not fully enclosed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="continuation">Continuation</h3>
    <p>When a viewer’s eye is compelled to follow a path from one object to another, or to follow a certain pattern of motion through time, the individual objects are perceived as a group.</p>
  </li>
