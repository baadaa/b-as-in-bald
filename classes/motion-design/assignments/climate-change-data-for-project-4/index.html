<ol>
  <li>Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around Earth, trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm. This phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect and is natural and necessary to support life on Earth. However, the buildup of greenhouse gases can change Earth’s climate and result in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems.<br>Source(s): <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/climate-change-basic-information">www.epa.gov/climatechange/climate-change-basic-information</a>

</li>
  <li>Scientists have known since the 1800s that greenhouse gases trap heat, preventing it from escaping to space. The warming effect of greenhouse gases is amplified by feedbacks, especially from water vapor (a powerful and plentiful natural greenhouse gas), leading to more warming and changes in climate.<br>Source(s): <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/frequently-asked-questions-about-climate-change">www.epa.gov/climatechange/frequently-asked-questions-about-climate-change</a>

  <li>The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased by more than 40% since pre-industrial times, and the current CO2 level is higher than it has been in at least 800,000 years.<br>Source(s): <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/frequently-asked-questions-about-climate-change">www.epa.gov/climatechange/frequently-asked-questions-about-climate-change</a>
</li>
  <li>Natural influences on climate, such as changes in solar radiation, natural cycles, volcanic eruptions, and the climate’s normal year-to-year variability, can’t fully explain the current warming trend. The climate changes observed in recent decades follow a number of patterns—such as cooling at high altitudes and more warming at night than during the day—that are consistent with what scientists would expect from an increase in greenhouse gases rather than changes in solar variability or other natural causes.<br>Source(s): <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/frequently-asked-questions-about-climate-change">www.epa.gov/climatechange/frequently-asked-questions-about-climate-change</a>
