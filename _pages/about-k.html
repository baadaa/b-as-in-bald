After discovering Saussure's concepts and Chomsky's theories in high school, it was not a coincidence that I chose linguistics as the first major and psychology as the second in university.</p><p>Introduced to an 8-bit MSX computer in third grade, I started programming in <span><small>BASIC</small></span>, creating simple games and geometric shapes. With the advent and evolution of internet, I naturally picked up <span><small>HTML/CSS</small></span>, later <span><small>JavaScript</small></span> and <span><small>Node.js</small></span>, and for a good while <span><small>ActionScript 3</small></span>. Projects in <span><small>WordPress</small></span> got me exposed to some <span><small>PHP</small></span> and <span><small>MySQL</small></span>, and the desire to create native apps led me to learn <span><small>Swift</small></span>. While my strength still lies in <span><small>HTML/(S)CSS/JS</small></span>, I continue to strive for better proficiency in wider platforms.">

I would sit hours on the floor just reading them, following random entry after entry like hypertext, lost in awe and fascination. Instinctively I knew that there is a vast abundance of knowledge and information in the world and felt so small and inspired at the same time. To this day, I'm thrilled upon entering a bookstore&mdash;online or offline&mdash;<span>at any opportunity to learn new things and acquire new skills</span>.</p><p>Trade in creative industry can be both a curse and a blessing for a person like myself, which presents an endless supply of new technology, developments, and standards at such breakneck speed that no one can <em>fully</em> keep up. The pressure could sometimes feel overwhelming but I also find it refreshing and thrilling that I can never afford to stay stagnant. Curiosity might kill the cat, but it definitely keeps me going.">
