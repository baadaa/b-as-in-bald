It was not a coincidence that I chose linguistics as the first major and psychology as the second in college. <em>Language</em> has long been my passion since childhood, and discovering Saussure's concepts and Chomsky's theories was a revelation to me.</p><p>In third grade, I was introduced to 8-bit MSX computer and started programming in <small>BASIC</small>, creating simple games and geometric drawings. With the advent of internet and evolution of it, I gradually and naturally picked up <small>HTML/CSS</small>, then <small>ActionScript 3</small>, and of course <small>JavaScript</small>. After having played with some <small>PHP</small> and <small>Swift</small>, my strength still lies in <small>HTML/CSS/JS</small> but I continue to strive for strengthening my multilingual ability in digital arena.">

Because, well, all human issues begin and end with humans, be it political, fashion, design, or whatever.</p><p>As a person, a dad, a neighbor, and in many other human roles, I find it immensely important to consider human values in any action I take and how it affects other fellow humans.</p><p>In professional settings, as a creative consultant, I focus on discovering problems and developing solutions by involving human perspectives in every step. Because I don't believe my job ends with designing a beautiful layout or programming a functional web application, but with presenting real human value to the user.">
