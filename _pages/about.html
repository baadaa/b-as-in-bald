It was not a coincidence that I chose linguistics as the first major and psychology as the second in college. <em>Language</em> has long been my passion since childhood, and discovering Saussure's concepts and Chomsky's theories was a revelation to me.</p><p>In third grade, I was introduced to 8-bit MSX computer and started programming in <span><small>BASIC</small></span>, creating simple games and geometric drawings. With the advent of internet and evolution of it, I gradually and naturally picked up <span><small>HTML/CSS</small></span>, then <span><small>ActionScript 3</small></span>, and of course <span><small>JavaScript</small></span>. After having played with some <span><small>PHP</small></span> and <span><small>Swift</small></span>, my strength still lies in <span><small>HTML/CSS/JS</small></span> but I continue to strive for strengthening my multilingual ability in digital arena.">
